# FarmChain

FarmChain is a Web3-based agro-finance platform built by our team to solve real-world problems in farming, such as unstable crop prices, lack of funding, and middlemen exploitation.

# ðŸ’¡ Idea:
Let investors directly fund verified farmers through blockchain using NFTs and smart contracts â€” no banks, no middlemen.

# ðŸš€ How it works:
1.Farmland NFTs
Each farm is tokenized as an ERC-721 NFT, representing ownership or future profit rights.

2.Smart Contracts
When someone invests, their funds are locked in smart contracts and used only for farming. It ensures transparency and security.

3.AI Price Prediction
We built an LSTM model that predicts crop prices based on market trends, weather, and global data. This helps farmers plan when to sell and helps investors know when to fund.

4.Decentralized Marketplace
A Web3 marketplace allows consumers to buy directly from verified farms using stablecoins â€” removing middlemen and ensuring fair prices.

5.Live Tracking
All farm-related activity (funding, expenses, profit distribution) is stored on-chain, so investors can track how their money is used in real-time.
